Automating compares is both more accurate
and faster than doing it manually.

Having access to a file's history
allows one to see both what has changed
and the layers of complexity that
have been added over time.

The benefits of manually committing files
is that it creates a logical history of the program
but autosaving has the added benefit
of removing user forgetfulness or error


For interrelated files, such as with code,
it helps to see related changes over time
for related files. For storage sites like
google docs, this is not a priority.

Using Git log and diff allows one to see the
differences from one file to another.

By having powerful version control systems
that allow differentiation and compare
there is less risk involved when innovating

I think I'll use git as I start writing
more complex projects and using frameworks
