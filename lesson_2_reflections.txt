Initializing a repository creates the hidden .git file
It does not make commits
It may be important to mark the first commit with a message
And so it must be done manually

A staging area is different from the working directory and repository
in that it is a temporary placeholder to which files can be added
without committing changes. It allows for a working area where decisions
about commits can be made and unmade without penalty.

Use the staging area to track what changes have been made
so that each command can be assigned to a logical change.
Powerful diff tools help to keep track of what each commit
will include.
