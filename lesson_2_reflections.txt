Initializing a repository creates the hidden .git file
It does not make commits
It may be important to mark the first commit with a message
And so it must be done manually

A staging area is different from the working directory and repository
in that it is a temporary placeholder to which files can be added
without committing changes. It allows for a working area where decisions
about commits can be made and unmade without penalty.
