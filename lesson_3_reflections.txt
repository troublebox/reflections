When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Working remotely allows for working in the cloud, collaboration, and sharing with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Pulling manually ensures that collaboration can work more smoothly,
and allows you to effectively use the remote repository as a back-up
in case you wish to experiment locally without fear of damaging
any code that others are viewing or using.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Branches allow for development of the same program in different sections
that can then be merged together and traced back for bug hunting. Clones
allow alternate versions to be moved around, so that entire projects can
be shared, distributed or collaborated upon. And forks do the same, for
GitHub users, but retain connection to the original creator.
